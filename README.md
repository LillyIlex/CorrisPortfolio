# My Portfolio

## A portfolio showing all my live web applications, as well as my work history and contact information.

This web application will help you delve a little deeper into who I am, what I do, and why I am here.
There are links to my live web app's for you to check out, as well as a breif bio section to get to know me better. It is also an chance for me to keep all my projects in one area, a great way to be able to show off what I have learnt so far.

###Usage

My portfolio is simple to follow. There is navigation menu at the top right which will take you to the 3 different sections of the page. There is also an image of my current websites in the 'work' section. Each title box is a clickable link that will take you to the full site for you to have a look around. Upon browsing and hovering, the images will enlarge a little for you to take a closer look, without leaving the current page. There is also a 'back to top' button to quicken the process of heading back to the navigation menu to further browse.
