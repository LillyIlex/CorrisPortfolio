# My Portfolio

## A portfolio showing all my live web applications, as well as my work history and contact information.

This web application should help you delve a little deeper into who I am, what I do, and why I am building this portfolio.
There are links to my live web app's for you to check out, as well as a breif bio section to get to know me better. It is also an chance for me to keep all my projects in one area, and to be able to show off what I have learnt so far.

###Usage

The website should be simple to follw. There is navigation bar with menu of different sections on the page. There is also an image of my current websites, each image is a clickable link that should take you to the full site for you to have a look around.

####Credits
I would like to pay credit to my tutor, Husman, and the Bootcamp team for helping guide me through my journey with code so far.
